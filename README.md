# 3D Star Collision Simulation

This Python project simulates a system of stars in 3D space, illustrating gravitational interactions and collisions. Stars move under gravitational forces, and when they collide, they merge into larger stars while conserving mass and momentum.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics**: Gravitational interactions between stars.
- **Star Collisions**: Stars merge on collision, conserving mass and momentum.
- **Visualization**: 3D visualization using Matplotlib.
- **Collision Logging**: Details of collisions are saved to a log file (`collision_log.txt`).
- **Dynamic Annotations**: Collision count, remaining stars, and last collision details displayed during the simulation.
